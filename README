This is a Task distribution.  See http://search.cpan.org/dist/Task

This distribution will require all distributions maintained by the Perl Email
Project.  http://emailproject.perl.org/

Installing this properly without using CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS will be a pain.  You
can run:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make # or your make tool of choice

This will list missing dependencies.  It will not install them.
